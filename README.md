## About this Book
Helium brings exciting new capabilities to microcontrollers, allowing sophisticated digital signal processing or machine learning applications to be run on inexpensive, low-power devices. In the early chapters, the book introduces fundamental concepts at a very basic and accessible level, including Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), vector processing, floating and fixed-point data representations, and saturation. After an overview of the MVE architecture, the instruction set is broken down into clear groups for discussion, covering subjects like pipeline structure, predication and branch handling, data processing and memory access.

The most practical sections of the book deal with the mechanics of coding for a Helium-capable core such as the Cortex-M55, including compilation, debug and optimization. Finally, the book concludes with chapters on how to implement DSP and ML workloads.

The book is intended to be useful to engineers and students who want to learn more about these new features.  Knowledge of Cortex-M processors and basic DSP theory is assumed, and some prior knowledge of C and Arm assembly language is a prerequisite.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This book may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms at the next edition and as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
